## DEFINITION OF DEVOPS
DevOps is a collection of practices designed to improve collaboration and communication between software development (Dev) and information technology operations (Ops) teams. 

### Benefits of Devops
1. DevOps principles provide rapid and continuous software delivery, minimizing the time required to provide new features and upgrades to users.

2. DevOps promotes a culture of collaboration and communication across development, operations, and other stakeholders, breaking down silos and allowing teams to work more efficiently toward common goals.

3. Automating repeated jobs and procedures simplifies operations, decreases manual errors, and increases overall efficiency.

4. Security is frequently a top priority in DevOps approaches throughout the software development lifecycle.

### HISTORY OF DEVOPS
DevOps evolved as a response to the issues provided by traditional software development and IT operations approaches, which frequently resulted in segregated teams, long release cycles, and inefficient processes. Patrick Debois and Andrew Shafer invented the phrase "DevOps" in 2009, and it has since become a popular paradigm for modern software development and operations.

### DEVOPS CULTURE
The DevOps culture values teamwork, communication, transparency, and shared accountability among development, operations, QA, security, and other teams involved in the software delivery process. It promotes a culture of ongoing learning, experimentation, and progress.

## SDLC (Software Development LifeCycle)
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a framework for planning, designing, developing, testing, deploying, and maintaining software applications. It consists of a series of phases or stages that guide the development process from conception to delivery and beyond.

### CONCEPTS OF SDLC
SDLC provides a structured approach to software development, outlining the steps and activities involved in creating and maintaining software applications. It typically includes phases such as requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

### WHY IT IS IMPORTANT TO DEVOPS ENGINEER
SDLC is important for a DevOps Engineer because it provides a framework for understanding the software development process and identifying opportunities for automation, integration, and improvement. DevOps Engineers play a key role in optimizing and streamlining the SDLC by implementing DevOps practices and tools to enhance collaboration, efficiency, and quality throughout the development lifecycle.

### WHERE DEVOPS FITS IN SDLC
DevOps practices and principles are integrated throughout the SDLC, from planning and development to testing, deployment, and operations.

# Introduction to Operating Systems
## What is an Operating System?
An operating system (OS) is a software program that acts as an intermediary between computer hardware and application software. It manages computer hardware resources, provides a user interface, and facilitates the execution of software programs.

## Tasks of an Operating System
The operating system (OS) performs a wide range of tasks to manage computer hardware resources, facilitate communication between hardware and software components, and provide a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the computer system. Some of the key tasks performed by an operating system include:

**Process Management**
1. Creating, scheduling, and terminating processes. 
2. Allocating CPU time to running processes.
3. Managing process states (e.g., running, waiting, ready, terminated).
4. Implementing mechanisms for process synchronization and communication.

**Memory Management**
1. Allocating and deallocating memory for processes.
2. Managing memory space, including virtual memory and paging.
3. Implementing memory protection to prevent unauthorized access to memory regions.
4. Handling memory fragmentation and optimizing memory usage.

**File System Management**
1. Organizing and managing files and directories on storage devices.
2. Providing file operations such as creation, deletion, reading, and writing.
3. Implementing file access permissions and security features.
4. Handling file system consistency and recovery in case of errors or failures.

**Device Management**
1. Interacting with hardware devices such as disk drives, printers, network interfaces, and input/output devices.
2. Providing device drivers to facilitate communication between the operating system and hardware devices.
3. Handling device interrupts and managing device resources.
4. Implementing device I/O operations such as reading from and writing to devices.

### Components of an Operating System
An operating system (OS) consists of several components that work together to manage computer hardware resources, facilitate communication between software applications and hardware devices, and provide a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the computer system. Some of the key components of an operating system include:

**Kernel**: The kernel is the core component of the operating system that provides essential services and functions, such as process management, memory management, device management, and system call handling. It interacts directly with the hardware and serves as an intermediary between applications and hardware resources.

**Device Drivers**: Device drivers are software modules that enable communication between the operating system and hardware devices such as disk drives, printers, network interfaces, and input/output devices (e.g., keyboard, mouse). Device drivers provide an interface for the operating system to access and control hardware devices, translating high-level commands from the OS into low-level instructions that the hardware can understand.

**File System**: The file system is responsible for organizing and managing files and directories on storage devices such as hard drives, solid-state drives (SSDs), and flash drives. It provides file operations such as file creation, deletion, reading, and writing, as well as mechanisms for file access permissions, security, and metadata management.

**Process Management**: Process management involves creating, scheduling, and controlling processes, which are instances of running programs. The operating system manages process states, allocates CPU time to running processes, handles process synchronization and communication, and provides mechanisms for process creation, termination, and resource sharing.

**Memory Management**: Memory management involves allocating and deallocating memory for processes, managing memory space, and implementing virtual memory and paging mechanisms. The operating system is responsible for managing system memory (RAM), ensuring efficient memory usage, handling memory fragmentation, and implementing memory protection to prevent unauthorized access to memory regions.

**Input/Output (I/O) Management**: Input/output management involves managing communication between software applications and peripheral devices such as keyboards, mice, displays, disk drives, and network interfaces. The operating system handles device I/O operations, manages device resources, and provides mechanisms for device detection, initialization, and interrupt handling.

**User Interface**: The user interface provides a means for users to interact with the operating system and perform tasks on the computer system. This can include command-line interfaces (CLI), graphical user interfaces (GUI), or both, depending on the operating system. The user interface facilitates user input, displays output, launches applications, and provides access to system settings and features.

**Networking**: Networking components enable communication between computers and devices over a network. The operating system supports network protocols, manages network interfaces and configurations, and provides mechanisms for network communication, such as sending and receiving data packets over the network.

### Types of Operating Systems
1. Single-User and Multi-User Operating Systems:
**Single-User Operating System**: Designed to support only one user at a time. Examples include Microsoft Windows, macOS, and various versions of Linux distributions for personal computers.
**Multi-User Operating System**: Designed to support multiple users simultaneously, allowing multiple users to access and interact with the system concurrently. Examples include Unix, Linux, and server versions of Microsoft Windows.

2. Single-Tasking and Multi-Tasking Operating Systems:
**Single-Tasking Operating System**: Can execute only one task or program at a time. Examples include older operating systems like MS-DOS (Microsoft Disk Operating System).
**Multi-Tasking Operating System**: Can execute multiple tasks or programs concurrently, allowing users to run multiple applications simultaneously. Examples include modern operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Distributed operating systems enable distributed computing, parallel processing, and resource sharing across a network. Examples include Amoeba, Google's Android (based on Linux), and Microsoft's Windows Distributed File System (DFS).

6. Embedded Operating Systems: Designed to run on embedded systems, which are specialized computing devices with limited hardware resources and specific functionality. Embedded operating systems are used in devices such as smartphones, tablets, IoT (Internet of Things) devices, automotive systems, and consumer electronics. Examples include Android (for smartphones and tablets), Embedded Linux, and RTOSs like FreeRTOS and ThreadX.

7. Mobile Operating Systems: Designed for mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets, and wearable devices. Mobile operating systems are optimized for touch-screen interfaces, mobility, and connectivity to cellular networks and wireless technologies. Examples include Android (developed by Google), iOS (developed by Apple), and Windows Mobile (developed by Microsoft, discontinued).

### Linux operating system
Linux is a widely-used open-source operating system kernel that serves as the foundation for numerous Linux distributions (distros) and Unix-like operating systems. Developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991, Linux is based on the Unix operating system and is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL), making it free and open-source software.

## Introduction to Virtualization and Virtual Machines

### What is Virtualization?
Virtualization is the process of creating a virtual (rather than physical) version of something, such as an operating system, a server, a storage device, or a network resource. It enables multiple virtual instances to run on a single physical machine, maximizing resource utilization and flexibility.

### What is a Server?
A server is a computer or system that provides resources, services, or functionality to other computers or clients over a network. Servers can be physical machines or virtualized instances running on a host machine.

### The Concept of Virtualization
Virtualization abstracts physical hardware resources and provides a virtualized environment that is isolated from the underlying hardware. This allows multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical machine, each with its own operating system and applications.

### What is a Virtual Machine (VM)?
A virtual machine (VM) is a software emulation of a physical computer that runs an operating system and applications. It operates like an independent computer within a host machine and can be created, managed, and destroyed dynamically.

### What is a Hypervisor?
A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor (VMM), is a software or firmware that creates and manages virtual machines. It abstracts and partitions the physical resources of a host machine to allocate them to VMs, allowing multiple operating systems to run concurrently on the same hardware.

### Physical Machine vs. Virtual Machine
|   | Physical Machine | Virtual Machine |
|---|------------------|-----------------|
| *Hardware* | Requires dedicated physical hardware. | Shares physical hardware resources with other VMs. |
| *Flexibility* | Limited flexibility in terms of hardware and software configurations. | Highly flexible with customizable configurations. |
| *Isolation* | Limited isolation between applications and services. | Provides strong isolation between VMs, enhancing security and stability. |
| *Resource Utilization* | Typically lower resource utilization. | Maximizes resource utilization by running multiple VMs on a single physical machine. |
| *Scalability* | Limited scalability without additional hardware. | Easily scalable by adding or removing virtual instances. |
